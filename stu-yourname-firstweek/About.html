        <h3>The three founders of Apple are Steve Wozniak , Steve Jobs and Ronald Wayne . Before co-founding Apple Computer Inc., Steve Wozniak was once an electronics engineer and in 1975 , he began attending the Homebrew Computer Club.

            At the time, only two microcomputer-CPU manufacturers, the Intels 8080, cost $ 179 and the Motorola 6800 cost $ 170. Wozniak favored the 6800 version, but had no idea what their products were. So he satisfied himself by reviewing, learning and designing computers on paper, until he got advice for a CPU. It was the best idea that happened to the computer market.
            
            When MOS Technologies released the famous 6502 product for $ 25 in 1976, Wozniak also started developing a BASIC publication for the chip. When he finished, he started designing a computer , so BASIC could run. The 6502 version was designed by many people, who also designed the 6800 version, when a lot of people in Silicon Valley left their workplaces to be independent. Wozniaks in front of computer drawings required only a few changes to run the new chip.
            
            He completed the apparatus and took it to the Homebrew Computer Club conference to present his system. There he met an old friend, Steve Jobs , who was excited about the future trading opportunity of these small machines.</h3>
